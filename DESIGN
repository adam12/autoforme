AutoForme is the spiritual successor to scaffolding_extensions,
though it has a completely different implementation.  It's
designed to do most of scaffolding_extensions can do, but be
more extensible.  Here are a few basic differences:

1) Uses Forme to create the forms, instead of building them manually,
   which allows for greater flexibility.

2) Does not use templates at all.  Renders all output to strings,
   which makes it much easier to integrate into web frameworks,
   and much easier to test.

3) Doesn't modify/extend model or controller classes at all.

4) Expects that the web framework provides the layout for the page,
   and does not allow overridding of the output by using your own
   template.  Instead, you should skip the handling of that action
   and just handle it yourself.

5) All configuration is done through a block-based DSL in the
   controller.

6) Have unit tests for all functionality.

7) Use a standard capybara/rack-test based integration test suite for
   testing web framework integration.

The following scaffolding_extensions features will not be supported:

1) Merging objects

2) NULL/NOT NULL columns for searches
